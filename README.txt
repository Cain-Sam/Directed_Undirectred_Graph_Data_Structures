Our professor gave us a class and some tests, and we had to create several functions to pass those tests using directed and undirected graphs. 
The class itself and the tests are written by him. The different functions being tested are written by me. I have clearly marked where my code 
begins and ends.

Simply run the tests and results will print in the console.
